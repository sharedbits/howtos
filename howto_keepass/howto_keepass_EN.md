## Introduction to the software

[KeePass][website] is a software from the "password managers" family. Its purpose is to save in an database file all off your passwords. This database is of course encrypted to guarantee the confidentialy of the information contained within.  
Other password manager softwares exist, but I have not tested them personally ([1Password][1password], [LastPass][lastpass], ...). [KeePass][website] is a good pick for managing your passwords since it's recommanded by the [ANSSI][anssi] (CERT-FR).

## Installation

### On Windows

The software can be downloaded from the official KeePass website, in [Downloads](https://keepass.info/download.html) section. Please make sure you download version 2.x.y, latest available and maintained version.  
The installation process is the same as for any other software.

### Language package installation

The language packages can be found in the [Translations](https://keepass.info/translations.html) section. Choose the language package corresponding to the downloaded and installed KeePass version.  
One the package is downloaded, open the KeePass software, go to "Display > Change Language...". On the bottom left part of the newly opened window, click on "Open Folder". The Windows Explorer opens up in the folder where all language packages are stored. Copy the downloaded language pack there.  
Relaunch KeePass, and re-select "Display > Change Language..." : your language is now available.
